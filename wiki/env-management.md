## Some important information

### Important files

* `pyproject.toml` is the single file for all project related metadata.
* `poetry.lock` file is the granular metadata.
* `.pypirc` will not work with poetry. 
* `config.toml` & `auth.toml` is used for setting up the artifact repository.
* export `POETRY_PYPI_TOKEN_PYPI`, export `POETRY_HTTP_BAISC_PYPI_USERNAME` and export `POETRY_HTTP_BAISC_PYPI_PASSWORD` can be used for this.

### Publishing library as artifact to artifact store

```toml
# config.toml : ~/.config/pypoetry/config.toml
[repositories]
pypi = {url = "https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/"}
testpypi = {url = "https://test.pypi.org/legacy/"}
```

```toml
# auth.toml: ~/.config/pypoetry/auth.toml
[http-basic]
pypi = {username = "myuser", password = "topsecret"}
testpypi = {username = "myuser", password = "topsecret"}
```
